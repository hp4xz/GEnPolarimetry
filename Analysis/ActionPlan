#1 Polarization Gradient Understanding

Take NMR at many different convection settings and compare to setting with no polarization gradient.
20.5 Hour test

Convection 18V - wait 30 minutes
- NMR every hour for 4 hours
Convection 15V
- NMR every hour for 4 hours
Convection 12V
- NMR every hour for 4 hours
Convection 9V
- NMR every hour for 4 hours
Convection 6V
- NMR every hour for 4 hours

#2 Lasers On/Off Test

To get a handle and temperatures, Laser on/off test for each cell should be completed.

#3 Ambient temperature NMR's

#4 We need to perform an analysis along the lines of what I show above for every set of
runs during which we have NMR measurements.

-How do I access list of all runs?

#6 We need to generate a table of polarization values for every run.

#7 We need to enumerate and understand any number of other systematic effects not
discussed here. For example, how do afp losses affect the polarizations that we assign
to each run?

-Target ladder motion for NMR
-I suggest doing EPR in the target position and looking at the pumping chamber difference

#8 What have I forgotten that needs to be done BEFORE wrapping up data taking for
Kin3?

Analysis
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*LoadNMR - Takes all NMR Data and two dates. Fits data in between two dates. Spits out text and array.

*CalibrateNMRFits - Takes an EPR date, two NMR dates, and calibration constant(%/khz) and returns calibration as well as temperatures for each NMR during calibration

*ReadEpics - Takes csv's gotten from WAVE online plotter and produces array of all temperatures and dates throughout the run

*LoadEPR - Takes all EPR and NMR data and produces array of all calibrations carried out with all temperatures and dates.

*FitRatios - Looks at ratios of my fits to the fits produced by the vi. Interestingly not constant.

*SweepRatios - Looks at pumping chamber ratios to target chamber with my fits. Interesting distributions indicate different settings

*Analysis - Starts by reproducing Gordon's analysis, but with my fits. Then I try my analysis using exact RTD readouts for each NMR.

*functions.py - all the functions I use throughout multiple scripts
